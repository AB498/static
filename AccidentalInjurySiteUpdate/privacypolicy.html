                            <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to
                                your personal data. Please go to the Glossary section to find out more about these
                                rights.</p>
                            <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out in the Glossary, please contact us.</p>
                            <h4>No fee usually required</h4>
                            <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the
                                other rights); however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly
                                unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your
                                request in these circumstances.</p>

                            <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and
                                ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other
                                rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any
                                person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
                                information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
                            <h4>Time limit to respond</h4>
                            <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take
                                us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number
                                of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

                            <p>You have the right to:</p>
                            <p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject
                                access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about
                                you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
                            <p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This
                                enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected,
                                though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
                            <p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
                                delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to
                                process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data
                                where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below),
                                where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to
                                erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always
                                be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
                                notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
                            <p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a
                                legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your
                                particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you
                                feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
                                object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some
                                cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your
                                information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                            <p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables
                                you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following
                                scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the
                                data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the
                                data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
                                legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify
                                whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
                            <p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party.
                                We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a
                                structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
                                automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we
                                used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
                            <p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process
                                your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing
                                carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not
                                be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is
                                the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
