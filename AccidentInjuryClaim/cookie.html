                                <h2>What cookies are used on this Website:</h2>
                                <p>The cookies we and our business partners use on this website are broadly grouped into
                                    the following categories:</p>
                                <p><strong>Essential</strong>&nbsp;– Some of the cookies on our website are essential
                                    for us to be able to provide you with a service you have requested. An example of
                                    this would be a cookie used to enable you to log into your account on the website or
                                    which allows communication between your browser and the website. Our cookie
                                    preference cookie described in the section "How can I reject or opt out of receiving
                                    cookies?" is also an essential cookie. You may not be able to use our website
                                    without these cookies.</p>
                                <p><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;– We use analytics cookies to helps us understand how
                                    users engage with our website. An example is counting the number of different people
                                    coming to our website or using a particular feature, rather than the total number of
                                    times the site or feature is used. Without this cookie, if you visited the website
                                    once each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. We would
                                    find it difficult to analyse how well our website was performing and improve it
                                    without these cookies.</p>
                                <p><strong>Social Sharing</strong>&nbsp;– We use cookies to allow you to share content
                                    directly on the social networking/sharing sites like Facebook, Twitter or Google+.
                                    Examples would be if you wanted to "like" or "tweet" about a business or product
                                    advertised on our website.</p>
                                <p><strong>Interest-Based Advertising</strong>&nbsp;– You will have noticed that when
                                    you visit websites you will be shown adverts for products and services you may wish
                                    to buy. The money made by website owners for showing third party adverts on their
                                    websites often pays for the cost of running the website and therefore usually allows
                                    you to use the website without having to pay a registration or usage fee. We, like
                                    many businesses may place adverts for ourselves on a range of associated websites.
                                    However, to try and ensure that the adverts you see are relevant to you we use
                                    cookies to collect information about the types of things that interest you, for
                                    example websites you visit and the geography that you are based in. Having these
                                    cookies does not increase the number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes
                                    the adverts you see more relevant.</p>
                                <h2>How can I reject or opt out of receiving cookies?</h2>
